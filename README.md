Simplify the connection between your shop and NewsMAN by installing this module and following the setup steps below. This process allows you to effortlessly sync customer and newsletter subscriber data, enable remarketing, and manage your email marketing campaigns.

> [!NOTE]
> For older PrestaShop versions, use the previous module releases:
> - **PrestaShop 1.8.x**: [Newsman/PrestaShop8-NewsMAN](https://github.com/Newsman/PrestaShop8-NewsMAN)
> - **PrestaShop 1.6.x – 1.7.x**: [Newsman/PrestaShop-Newsman](https://github.com/Newsman/PrestaShop-Newsman)

# Installation

> [!WARNING]
> If you have an older version of the module installed (previously named `newsmanapp` or `newsman`), you must **uninstall** it first and then **delete** it from **Admin > Modules > Module Manager** before installing version 9.0.0 or greater. The new module uses a different internal name (`newsmanv8`) and cannot upgrade from the old one directly.

## Manual installation (download archive and upload):
1. Download the latest **newsmanv8.zip** archive from [releases](https://github.com/Newsman/PrestaShop9-NewsMAN/releases) (Git tags 9.x.x-autoload, link in the right sidebar here on GitHub). The archive newsmanv8.zip contains the module with the generated `vendor/autoload.php` which is required.
2. Go to **Admin > Modules > Module Manager > Upload a module** and upload the **newsmanv8.zip** archive.
3. After installation, find **Newsman** in the module list and click **Configure**.
4. At this step you will need to click on the **Connect with Newsman** button and follow the steps to complete the configuration:
   - Authenticate in newsman.app.
   - Allow access to your Newsman account in your store.
   - Select the email list from the dropdown and save the settings.
5. After completing the OAuth flow, you will be redirected to the module configuration page where you can adjust all settings.
6. If there are any errors, repeat the configuration using the **Reconfigure** button on the settings page. Also you can check PrestaShop logs for more information in **Admin > Advanced Parameters > Logs** or in the Newsman log viewer at **Admin > Modules > Newsman > Logs**.
   You can increase the log level from the module configuration under Developer settings.

## Additional steps:
1. Review all settings on the Newsman configuration page for your preferred configuration.
2. Verify the storefront for Newsman remarketing JavaScript code.
3. You can also use the debugger in **newsman.app > Integrations > NewsMAN Remarketing > "Check installation"** button.
   The debugger is similar to Google GTM debugger and shows if the events are tracked correctly by NewsMAN remarketing.

## Manual installation (create archive from source):
1. Download from GitHub repository > top right corner **Code** > Download ZIP. Unarchive the downloaded file.
2. Go to the downloaded directory and run `composer install --no-dev` to install the dependencies.
3. Alternatively, use the build script: `./tools/developer/build-release-zip.sh /path/to/modules/newsmanv8 php8.2 /usr/local/bin/composer /tmp/newsmanv8.zip`
4. Upload the resulting **newsmanv8.zip** via **Admin > Modules > Module Manager > Upload a module**.
